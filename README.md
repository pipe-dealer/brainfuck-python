Simple Brainfuck IDE in Python

##Introduction
Brainfuck is a esoteric programming language created in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller. What makes it unique is that it only uses 8 operators, ```<>+-[].,```. While this might seem simple and easy, don't be fooled. Printing even one character requires a lot of time, and trying to make a program, while is possible, gives you a 'brainfuck', hence the name.

Before staring your Brainfuck journey, a few things are required. First off is a compiler. There are a few ways to get a compiler. The easiest way is to use ```python-brainfuck``` [libary](https://pypi.org/project/python-brainfuck/) or use someone else's. I recommend [@horellana's](https://github.com/horellana/brainfuck.py) compiler. This was the one I used temporarily. For the more experienced coders, you can always try to make your own. For reference, I've included mine, but its a very simple one, meant for python only.

Second, a ASCII chart is recommended. Brainfuck uses ASCII to print out characters, and store values. A calculator and some paper is also helpful, especially dealing with a complex program.
